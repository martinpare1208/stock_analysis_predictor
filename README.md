## How it Works

My Stock Analysis script is created in Jupyter Lab and uses numerous libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and XGBoost. It is located in **jupyternotebook -> jupyternotebook -> StockAnalysisApp.ipynb** You select whichever ticker you desire and the close prices
will be plotted utilizing matplotlib. Then I utilized AI to train the model to predict closing prices via regression modeling.
In the script, we train the model with the first 50 days and the testing data will be used on the last 50 days of stock prices.


## What I learned and the End Results

This was my first Data Science/Data Analysis project. I learned how to read and manipulate pandas dataframes and use matplotlib to plot important points.
