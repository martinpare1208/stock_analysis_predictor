## About me:
Hello! My name is Martin Pare, I am a current Information Systems Major from University of Maryland. I am learning computer programming on the side and I am enjoying coding in Python and doing Full-Stack Web Development.

## What is the Stock Analysis Predictor App you created?

My Stock Analysis script is created in Jupyter Lab and uses numerous libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and XGBoost. It is located in **jupyternotebook -> jupyternotebook -> StockAnalysisApp.ipynb** You select whichever ticker you desire and the close prices
will be plotted utilizing matplotlib. Then I utilized ML to train the model to predict closing prices via linear regression.
In the script, we train the model with the first 50 days and the testing data will be used on the last 50 days of stock prices.
